        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div>My name is Jonas Noah Cicek, born on 10.04.1998 in Paderborn. <br>I grew up in HÃ¶velhof, Germany and still live here. <br>As you have already seen in the career tab, after graduating from high school I wanted to become a wholesale and foreign trade merchant. <br>After a few years of working, I changed my mind and decided to train as an expert for cloud and web development at Techstarter.</div>

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
<br>
<br>
        <div>Cars have been a big part of my life since I was a child and I have always been fascinated by them. <br>I myself drive a Mercedes that I have restored. Apart from that, I've enjoyed making music for a few years now. <br>I am also a gamer who enjoys playing computer games.</div>
